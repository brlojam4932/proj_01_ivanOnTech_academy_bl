My goal was to create a phone book list where one would create new contacts after logging in to a simulated log-in form and then finally search for the contacts saved during the session, based on a name search to find the number. 

The purpose was to expand on the exercise, "Find the Number" but with HTML, CSS and JSON files.

I managed to almost complete my goal but I missed the final step of finding the number. Of course I did this in the exercise but it was much more difficult to do this without a pre-existing list.

I spent almost three weeks creating this project but two weeks on trying to solve the "find the number" problem. I tried so many methods and created many verisons. I tried converting to JSON files but I could not load them back in, methods and Ajax but nothing worked...I went down several rabit holes.
I had version where they worked on their own or with an exixting data base but not with the my final design, where you had to create data and then rerieve it.

So my final Project is not so final as I will have to return to it at some point in the future where I can figure it out or maybe I can get some help from you guys.

When you load the page, there is a log-in form that works and one can add conctacts to the phone list. To recall the number, it does not work. It cannot read the data.
